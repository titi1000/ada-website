Nowadays, accessing movies is not a problem. From a japanese animes to Charlie Chaplin deaf movies, through big american blockbusters, the movie industry was never this reachable. Streaming platforms, movie theatres, DVDs, and television have revolutionned cinema over time. Everything started with some guys named Les Frères Lumières in 1895 who projected what is considered as the firt public screening of projected motion pictures in Paris, and since and then now, history wrote herself. Our grandparents were forced to watch political propagandas during the wars, our parents assisted to the apparition of the dgi with some very well known franchises such as Star Wars, Indiana Jones or Jurassic Parc, and us... do you remember covid?

But this is our story. Were people all around the world affected the same way as us? And what about their home country film industries? We will first analyze how have regional and global film industries evolved over time and how have shifts in economic and demographic context influenced the development in filmmaking. We will show to what extend did the most important events of the last decade impact the cinematogtaphic production within each country. Then, we will see how have regional traits like themes, genres, and local actors evolved compared to global trends? Moreover, how has the rising popularity of local actors affected films' success at home and their appeal abroad?

During the 90s, we can see the emerging countries (India, China and Brazil for example) starting to develop their industries and quickly becoming a major part of global cinema.
